              I define antiques not as merely old things, but as valued, artificial productions that inspire us to look back to the past. Leon Rosenstein has a similar view, but I think he is mistaken to further restrict antiques to ‘handcrafted’ objects, or to ‘beautiful’ things, or to nonsouvenirs. Antiques also include trinkets for collectors, cheap tools for the handyman, and decoration for the front-yard gardener.

                At fine art stores, sellers do most of the sorting work themselves, as they have chosen only the most valuable objects to offer for sale. But in most circumstances, the burden of sorting through the material culture of the past is on the buyer, who sifts through objects to find what is useful, visually pleasing, or priced at a bargain. Collectors sort with purpose and hope to find exceptional objects in the common horde.
