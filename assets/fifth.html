    "See dazzling bowls and vessels, pots of brass
    Old copper kettles, cups of gold, and chiming clock
    Porcelain statuettes, fake Tiffanies, stained glass
    Oak storage towers, ivories of High Baroque 
    Stroll down the antiques on Sunday noon
    I’m fascinated by the scarab sooty bronze
    I lost my face inside the silver spoon
    In tapestries of life, with nymphs and fauns
    We’ve changed, in this abundance of disclosure
    Now I’m a voluntary slave on remnant sale
    That figurine of steadfast tin soldier
    Ready to burn for nothing in your tale." <br> -Gregory Colodub</div>

    <h2>Here! Here!</h2>
    <p>Old Furniture
I know not how it may be with others
Who sit amid relics of householdry
That date from the days of their mothers’ mothers.
But well I know how it is with me
Continually.
I see the hands of the generations
That owned each shiny familiar thing
In play on its knobs and indentations,
And with its ancient fashioning
Still dallying:
Hands behind hands, growing paler and paler,
As in a mirror a candle-flame
Shows images of itself, each frailer
As it recedes, though the eye may frame
Its shape the same.
On the clock’s dull dial a foggy finger,
Moving to set the minutes right
With tentative touches that lift and linger
In the wont of a moth on a summer night,
Creeps to my sight.
On this old viol, too, fingers are dancing –
As whilom – just over the strings by the nut,
The tip of a bow receding, advancing
In airy quivers, as if it would cut
The plaintive gut.
And I see a face by that box for tinder,
Glowing forth in fits from the dark,
And fading again, as the linten cinder
Kindles to red at the flinty spark,Or goes out 
stark.Well, well. It is best to be up and 
doing,The world has no use for one today who 
eyes things thus – no aim pursuing! He should not 
continue in this stay,but sink away.
-Thomas Hardy-
