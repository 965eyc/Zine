    In the antique store an old physician’s desk,
    walnut and marble-topped,holding the remnants
    of a life of service; stories etched in 
    wood, metal and stone.
    Next to part of an old syringe,a can of ether, 
    half full;it’s lid rusted shut
    and a stethoscope sporting the cracked rubber
    tubing, of a bygone era.
    A clock that once worked, a necessity for 
    any physician or scientist; 
    it died at lunchtime.
    A gilt-framed memoir of time served abroad.
    Life stories abound in old antique shops;
    shh...you can almost hear them 
    whispered tales,ethereal remnants,
    for the purchase.

    <h2>Here! Here!</h2>
    <p>Old Furniture
I know not how it may be with others
Who sit amid relics of householdry
That date from the days of their mothers’ mothers.
But well I know how it is with me
Continually.
I see the hands of the generations
That owned each shiny familiar thing
In play on its knobs and indentations,
And with its ancient fashioning
Still dallying:
Hands behind hands, growing paler and paler,
As in a mirror a candle-flame
Shows images of itself, each frailer
As it recedes, though the eye may frame
Its shape the same.
On the clock’s dull dial a foggy finger,
Moving to set the minutes right
With tentative touches that lift and linger
In the wont of a moth on a summer night,
Creeps to my sight.
On this old viol, too, fingers are dancing –
As whilom – just over the strings by the nut,
The tip of a bow receding, advancing
In airy quivers, as if it would cut
The plaintive gut.
And I see a face by that box for tinder,
Glowing forth in fits from the dark,
And fading again, as the linten cinder
Kindles to red at the flinty spark,Or goes out 
stark.Well, well. It is best to be up and 
doing,The world has no use for one today who 
eyes things thus – no aim pursuing! He should not 
continue in this stay,but sink away.
-Thomas Hardy-
